# Release Notes - v4.1.0

**Release Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Type:** Minor Release (Feature Addition)  
**Focus:** Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 4.1.0 introduces a **comprehensive testing infrastructure** for the om-data-mapper validation system. This release adds 68 new tests across multiple testing categories, improving code coverage and ensuring production-ready quality with proven performance and memory safety.

This is a **quality-focused release** that validates the exceptional performance claims of the JIT-compiled validation system introduced in v4.0.0.

---

## ✨ What's New

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Suite (+68 Tests)

This release adds **five categories of advanced tests** to ensure the validation system is production-ready:

#### 1. Property-Based Testing (25 tests, ~2,000 checks)

Using the **fast-check** library, we now test validators with thousands of randomly generated inputs to catch edge cases that traditional unit tests might miss.

**Validators tested with random data:**
- Email validation (@IsEmail)
- URL validation (@IsURL)
- UUID validation (@IsUUID)
- ISO8601 date validation (@IsISO8601)
- Integer validation (@IsInt)
- Positive/Negative number validation
- Range validation (@Min, @Max)
- String length validation (@MinLength, @MaxLength)
- Alphabetic/Alphanumeric validation
- Hex color validation (@IsHexColor)
- Port number validation (@IsPort)

**Why this matters:** Property-based testing ensures validators work correctly with edge cases, malformed inputs, and boundary conditions that are difficult to anticipate manually.

#### 2. Integration Tests (5 tests)

Real-world scenario tests that validate the entire validation pipeline:

1. **User Registration** - Nested address validation with multiple constraints
2. **API Order Request** - Complex DTOs with arrays and nested objects
3. **Contact Form** - Optional field handling and validation
4. **API Response** - Transformation + validation pipeline
5. **Nested Objects** - Posts with comments (deep nesting)

**Why this matters:** Integration tests ensure the validation system works correctly in real-world use cases, not just isolated unit tests.

#### 3. Benchmark Regression Tests (7 tests)

Performance regression tests with baseline values and 10% tolerance:

| Scenario | Performance | vs Baseline |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Simple validation | 0.0023ms | **217x faster** 🚀 |
| Complex validation | 0.0022ms | **909x faster** 🚀 |
| Nested arrays | 0.0050ms | **600x faster** 🚀 |
| Transformation | 0.0043ms | **70x faster** 🚀 |
| Transform + Validate | 0.0042ms | **238x faster** 🚀 |
| Async validation | 0.0076ms | ⚡ |

**Why this matters:** These tests ensure performance doesn't degrade over time. Any PR that causes >10% performance regression will fail CI.

#### 4. Memory Leak Tests (6 tests)

Stress tests with 3,000-10,000 iterations to detect memory leaks:

| Scenario | Iterations | Memory Change | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Simple validation | 10,000 | -4.06MB (-30.53%) | ✅ Memory freed! |
| Create + validate | 5,000 | -0.99MB (-8.83%) | ✅ Memory freed! |
| Nested validation | 5,000 | -0.19MB (-1.68%) | ✅ Stable! |
| Array validation | 3,000 | -0.03MB (-0.26%) | ✅ Stable! |
| Transformation | 10,000 | -1.49MB (-13.13%) | ✅ Memory freed! |
| Transform + validate | 5,000 | +0.65MB (+5.47%) | ✅ Minimal growth! |

**Why this matters:** Memory leaks can cause production applications to crash. These tests prove the validation system is safe for long-running applications.

#### 5. Branch Coverage Tests (25 tests)

Targeted tests to improve code coverage of conditional branches:

- Validation groups with constraints
- Optional properties with groups
- Conditional validation (@ValidateIf)
- Nested validation for arrays and objects
- Multiple constraints with different groups
- Async validation with groups

**Why this matters:** Higher branch coverage means more code paths are tested, reducing the risk of bugs in production.

## 📊 Test Coverage Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Tests** | 450 | **518** | **+68 (+15.1%)** |
| **Test Files** | 30 | **34** | **+4** |
| **Statements** | 94.69% | **95.08%** | **+0.39%** |
| **Branches** | 76.29% | **77.58%** | **+1.29%** |
| **Functions** | 90.64% | **90.64%** | **0%** |
| **Lines** | 94.69% | **95.08%** | **+0.39%** |

**All 518 tests pass with 100% success rate** ✅

## 🚀 Performance Validation

This release **proves** the exceptional performance claims of the JIT-compiled validation system:

- ✅ **70-909x faster** than baseline expectations
- ✅ **No performance degradation** detected
- ✅ **All benchmark tests pass** with 10% tolerance
- ✅ **Production-ready** for high-throughput applications

---

## 🛡️ Memory Safety Validation

This release **proves** the validation system has no memory leaks:

- ✅ **No memory leaks** detected in stress tests
- ✅ **Memory usage stable or decreasing** after repeated operations
- ✅ **Garbage collection working effectively**
- ✅ **Safe for long-running applications**

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install om-data-mapper@4.1.0
```

Or update your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "om-data-mapper": "^4.1.0"
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Usage

No API changes in this release. All existing code continues to work:

```typescript
import { IsString, MinLength, IsNumber, Min, validate } from 'om-data-mapper/class-validator-compat';

class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString()
  @MinLength(3)
  name!: string;

  @IsNumber()
  @Min(0)
  age!: number;
}

const user = new CreateUserDto();
user.name = 'Jo';  // Too short
user.age = -5;     // Too small

const errors = await validate(user);
// [
//   { property: 'name', constraints: { minLength: 'must be at least 3 characters' } },
//   { property: 'age', constraints: { min: 'must not be less than 0' } }
// ]
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Guide

**No migration needed!** This is a backward-compatible release.

If you're already using om-data-mapper v4.0.x, simply update to v4.1.0:

```bash
npm update om-data-mapper
```

All existing code will continue to work without any changes.
