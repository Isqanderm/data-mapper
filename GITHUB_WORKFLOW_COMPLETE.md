## üìã Workflow Steps Completed

### ‚úÖ Step 1: GitHub Issue Created

**Issue #26**: "Add automated code coverage protection for pull requests"

- **URL**: https://github.com/Isqanderm/data-mapper/issues/26
- **Status**: Open
- **Labels**: enhancement, ci/cd, testing
- **Description**: Comprehensive issue describing the implementation, motivation, and expected behavior

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Feature Branch Created

**Branch**: `feat/coverage-protection`

- Created from `main` branch
- Follows repository naming convention
- Successfully pushed to remote

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Changes Committed

Three logical commits created following Conventional Commits format:

#### Commit 1: CI/CD Workflow Changes
```
ci: add coverage protection check to block PRs with decreased coverage

- Add new coverage-check job that runs on all pull requests
- Compare coverage between PR branch and main branch
- Track 4 metrics: lines, statements, functions, branches
- Block PR merge if any metric decreases (zero-tolerance policy)
- Post detailed coverage comparison comment on PRs
- Show visual indicators (üìà increase, ‚û°Ô∏è same, üìâ decrease)
- Fail CI step if coverage drops to prevent merge

This ensures code quality is maintained or improved with every PR.

Closes #26
```

**Files Changed**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/COVERAGE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (new)
- `COVERAGE_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` (new)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (new)
- `docs/COVERAGE_PROTECTION.md` (new)

#### Commit 2: Configuration Updates
```
chore: update codecov and vitest config for coverage protection

- Update codecov.yml threshold from 1% to 0% (zero-tolerance)
- Add if_ci_failed: error to fail CI on coverage drops
- Add json-summary reporter to vitest config
- Generate coverage-summary.json for CI comparison

These changes enforce strict coverage requirements and provide
the necessary data for automated coverage comparison.

Related to #26
```

**Files Changed**:
- `codecov.yml`
- `vitest.config.mts`

#### Commit 3: Documentation Updates
```
docs: add coverage protection documentation and update guides

- Add coverage protection section to README.md
- Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with coverage requirements
- Add step-by-step guide for checking coverage locally
- Update PR requirements to include coverage as blocking
- Add troubleshooting tips for coverage issues

This provides clear guidance for contributors on how to maintain
code coverage and fix coverage-related PR failures.
