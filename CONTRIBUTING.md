## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Make Your Changes

1. Write your code following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Update documentation if necessary
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
6. Ensure formatting is correct: `npm run format:check`

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This enables automatic changelog generation and semantic versioning.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add support for nested array mapping"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with undefined values in deep mapping"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: redesign mapper API

BREAKING CHANGE: The create method now requires explicit type parameters"
```

### Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the name of the affected module:
- `mapper`
- `utils`
- `types`
- `ci`
- `deps`

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(mapper): add caching support"
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Update your branch with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Ensure all checks pass:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   ```

3. Update documentation if needed

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the repository on GitHub and create a Pull Request

3. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers (if applicable)
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Checklist completion

4. Wait for review and address feedback

### PR Requirements

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ **Code coverage maintained or improved** (blocking requirement)
- ✅ Code is linted and formatted
- ✅ Documentation is updated
- ✅ Commit messages follow conventions
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Approved by at least one maintainer

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type aliases for complex types

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for public APIs

### File Organization

```
src/
  ├── Mapper.ts       # Main mapper class
  ├── interface.ts    # Type definitions
  ├── utils.ts        # Utility functions
  └── index.ts        # Public exports
```

## Testing

### 🛡️ Code Coverage Protection

**Important:** This repository has automated code coverage protection enabled. All pull requests must maintain or improve the current code coverage percentage.

- ✅ **Coverage maintained or improved** → PR can be merged
- ❌ **Coverage decreased** → PR is automatically blocked

When you submit a PR, the CI will:
1. Run tests on your branch and collect coverage
2. Run tests on the main branch and collect coverage
3. Compare the coverage metrics
4. Post a detailed comparison comment on your PR
5. **Block the PR from merging** if coverage decreases

See the [Coverage Protection Guide](./docs/COVERAGE_PROTECTION.md) for detailed information on:
- How to check coverage locally
- How to identify uncovered code
- How to fix coverage issues
- Best practices for writing tests

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Write tests for bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **Ensure your tests cover all new/modified code**

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { Mapper } from '../src';

describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = { /* ... */ };
    
    // Act
    const result = Mapper.create(/* ... */).execute(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(/* ... */);
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npx vitest tests/smoke.test.ts
```

### Checking Coverage Locally

Before submitting your PR, verify that coverage is maintained:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm test

# Open the HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html

# Check coverage summary in terminal
# The output will show coverage percentages for:
# - Lines
# - Statements
# - Functions
# - Branches
```

The HTML report will highlight:
- ✅ **Green**: Covered lines
- ❌ **Red**: Uncovered lines
- ⚠️ **Yellow**: Partially covered branches

Focus on covering the red and yellow lines in your tests.
